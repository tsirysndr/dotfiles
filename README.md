# My Personal Dotfiles 🏠 💻 ✨

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles. I use these to configure my system to my liking. I use these dotfiles on both my personal and work machines. I use [envhub](https://github.com/tsirysndr/envhub) to manage my dotfiles, secrets and packages.

## 🚚 Installation

```sh
envhub use github:tsirysndr/dotfiles
```
