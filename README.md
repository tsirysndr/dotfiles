# My Personal Dotfiles 🏠 💻 ✨

[![ci](https://github.com/tsirysndr/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tsirysndr/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles. I use these to configure my system to my liking. I use these dotfiles on both my personal and work machines. I use [envhub](https://github.com/tsirysndr/envhub) to manage my dotfiles, secrets and packages.

> [!NOTE]
> * All my dotfiles, secrets and packages are restored by [envhub](https://github.com/tsirysndr/envhub) from this repository.
> * All my secrets are encrypted and stored in [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) and  [Cloudflare Workers Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/), see [secrets](https://github.com/tsirysndr/secrets) for more details.
